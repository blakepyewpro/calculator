# Calculator

This is a personal project using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a simple interactive calculator. The goals of the project are as follows:

- Design a functional interface and cohesive styling for the calculator
- Implement buttons that interact with the calculator display in the same fashion as a physical calculator
- Implement handling for the calculator display (and associated variables) that allows for consecutive button presses to append numbers as expected
